As English is a non-vocational course, the skills developed 
outside your study are also vital in developing a well-rounded CV. 
While at university, for example, many English students write for student newspapers and magazines, 
get involved with student info@nostarch.com radio or film societies, or volunteer in the community or local schools. Evidence of any skills gained from work experience and extracurricular activities, 
as well as through study, can help boost your job prospects.
